    "content": "I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men like this but I will not become an executioner. My anger outweighs my guilt. It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.\n\n It was a dog. It was a big dog. Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. I'm not wearing hockey pads. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.\n\n Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.\n\n Does it come in black? My anger outweighs my guilt. Does it come in black? I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.\n\n It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.\n\n",
